# **Data Visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn (Python)**

Educational program with **3 practical examples** of charts for analyzing data using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**. Ideal for learning data visualization in a simple and effective way.

### **What this code does exactly**

#### **Exercise 1 – Bar Chart**

* Creates a DataFrame with sales of 8 products in 3 cities (Bogotá, Cali, Medellín)
* Generates a **bar chart** comparing sales by product and city
* Uses Seaborn for a clean style and Matplotlib to display the chart

#### **Exercise 2 – Line Chart**

* Creates a DataFrame with monthly sales (8 months) of 3 products in different cities
* Generates a **line chart** with markers to show monthly trends
* Visualizes how sales evolve over time

#### **Exercise 3 – Scatter Plot**

* Creates a DataFrame with study hours, score, and motivation level
* Generates a **scatter plot** where:

  * The size and color of the points represent the motivation level
  * Includes a color bar to interpret motivation values

### **Example output**

* Prints the DataFrames in the console
* Displays 3 independent charts:

  1. Grouped bar chart by product and city
  2. Line chart with points for monthly sales
  3. Scatter plot with varying point size/color

### **Concepts it teaches perfectly**

* DataFrames with Pandas
* Themes and palettes with Seaborn
* Chart types with Matplotlib (bar, line, scatter)
* Customization: titles, labels, rotation, colorbar
* Visualization of real-world data (sales, study habits)

### **Ideal for**

* Data science and visualization students
* Intermediate Python classes
* Data analysis exercises
* Preparing for dashboards or reports

**100% pure Python** – uses Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn (install them with pip if you don’t have them)

Perfect as a base to expand: add more data, interactivity with Plotly, export to PDF, etc.

**Three clear and functional examples to master plotting in Python!**
